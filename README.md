# FRC Robotics
This is the source code for the software of my robotics team. As the head programmer, I wrote all the functionality for the robot's climbing, shooting, and movement functionality. I also wrote the code for the autonomous routines for the FRC robotics competition, which consisted of several challenges and obstacle courses. Our robot got first place in North Carolina in the autonomous routine and placed top 5 in the semi-autonomous routines.

## How it works
This project is built in Java, using object-oriented programming (OOP). The code integrates the WPILib software, a comprehensive library tailored for FRC robots to streamline hardware interfacing. Proportional-Integral-Derivative (PID) control algorithms were also used to achieve precise and responsive control over robot movements. The code also integrates a variety of sensors, such as encoders, to provide real-time data for accurate navigation and control. These tools were used to develop an effective system to do autonomous tasks. Things like driver feedback via visual and auditory feedback mechanisms such as LED indicators were also implemented in code. Significant testing procedures were also done, including basic simulation and real trials to fine-tune PID constants and autonomous routines.
